# FFT (Fast Fourier Transform).
This is a simple project to learn about the FFT algorithm which has and will become handy, it takes in a csv file with plotted points which then are read into the fft and it outputs the frequencies. If the signal is not a power of two it will zero-pad it so that it is, this is due to a limitation with the algorithm being used. This is made for academical purposes, take the outputs with a grain of salt if they are zero-padded, theoretically they can be used to reconstruct the original signal but one often has to be careful with these.
